## What is dble?

dble is a high scalability middle-ware for MySQL sharding. 

- __Sharding__
As your business grows, you can use dble to replace the origin single MySQL instance. 

- __Compatible with MySQL protocol__
Use dble as same as MySQL. You can replace MySQL with dble to power your application without changing a single line of code in most cases.

- __High availability__
dble server can used as clustered, business will not suffer with single node fail.

- __SQL Support__
Support(some in Roadmap) SQL 92 standard and MySQL dialect. We support complex SQL query like group by, order by, distinct, join ,union, sub-query(in Roadmap) and so on.

- __Complex Query Optimization__
Optimize the complex query, including, without limitation, Global-table join sharding-table, ER-relation tables, Sub-Queries, Simplifying select items, and the like.

- __Distributed Transaction__
Support Distributed Transaction using two-phase commit. You can choose normal mode for performance or XA mode for data safe, of course, the XA mode dependent on MySQL-5.7's XA Transaction, MySQL node's high availability and data reliability of disk.


## History
dble is based on [MyCat](https://github.com/MyCATApache/Mycat-Server). First we should thanks to MyCat's contributors.

For us, focus on MySQL is a better choice. So we cancelled the support for other databases, deeply improved/optimized its behavior on compatibility, complex query and distributed transaction. And of course, fixed lots of bugs.
